# Limitations & Safety Constraints

## This is not legal advice

JurisSearch provides **research synthesis and decision support**.  
It does not replace attorney judgment or provide legal advice.

## Known technical limitations (general)

- **Source availability:** results depend on accessible repositories and licensing constraints
- **Jurisdiction ambiguity:** unclear scope can degrade output quality
- **Conflicting authority:** splits may require human interpretation
- **Novel fact patterns:** limited precedent can reduce confidence
- **Model limitations:** LLMs may produce plausible but incorrect statements without strict gating

## Safety measures (publicly describable)

- claim–citation alignment checks
- structured outputs with required citations for material claims
- confidence indicators and uncertainty labeling
- escalation for low confidence or restricted contexts
- redaction/DLP pass before export

## What we do NOT publish here

- prompts and system instructions
- proprietary scoring heuristics
- connector configurations
- customer data and privileged documents
- production runbooks or incident playbooks
