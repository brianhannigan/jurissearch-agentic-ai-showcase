# Overview — JurisSearch (Legal Intelligence via Agentic AI)

## Problem statement

Legal research and strategy development face recurring friction:

- **Information overload:** thousands of cases, statutes, regulations, and secondary sources
- **Cross-jurisdiction complexity:** similar issues resolve differently across courts and forums
- **Time pressure:** litigation and advisory timelines often exceed human research capacity
- **Translation gap:** research output often fails to become *strategy* (what to argue, avoid, prioritize)
- **Auditability:** stakeholders require defensible reasoning (what sources drove the recommendation?)

## Why Agentic AI (not a chatbot)

A chatbot answers a question once.

**Agentic AI** runs a **multi-step, tool-using workflow** that resembles how expert teams work:
1. clarify scope and jurisdictional constraints
2. retrieve and normalize sources
3. rank and cluster case law by relevance and reasoning
4. extract holdings, standards, fact patterns, and outcome drivers
5. evaluate risks and opposing arguments
6. synthesize into structured deliverables (briefing, strategy, risk map)
7. generate an evidence trail for audit and review

JurisSearch is designed to:
- **separate retrieval from reasoning**
- enforce **policy gates** before using sensitive tools
- maintain **traceability** from summary → claims → citations

## Target users

- Litigation partners and associates
- In-house counsel and legal ops
- Compliance/legal risk strategists
- Researchers and policy analysts
- Expert witnesses and consultants

## Core use cases

### 1) Litigation strategy brief
- Issue: “Does X constitute Y under Z standard in this jurisdiction?”
- Output: controlling tests, favorable cases, adverse cases, argument map, risk flags, recommended narrative

### 2) Precedent terrain map
- Issue: “How do courts split on this issue across circuits/states?”
- Output: jurisdictional split table + dominant rationales + best supporting authorities

### 3) Opponent argument anticipation
- Issue: “If opposing counsel argues A, what cases support that and how do we counter?”
- Output: top cases for A + weaknesses + counter-authorities + framing options

### 4) Executive legal risk briefing (non-lawyer ready)
- Issue: “Summarize the legal landscape for leadership decisions”
- Output: 1–2 page summary, major risk themes, confidence bands, decision options

## Non-goals (what JurisSearch is NOT)

- Not a substitute for attorney judgment
- Not a “one-click legal advice generator”
- Not a citation-only search engine (it *synthesizes* and *explains*)
- Not a black box: outputs are paired with **citations** and **review checkpoints**
